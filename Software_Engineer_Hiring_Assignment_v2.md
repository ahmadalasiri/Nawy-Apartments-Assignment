## Software Engineer Hiring Assignment

Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

Your mission is to create a simple **listing apartments app** that allows the user to see more details about each apartment. ðŸš€

### You should implement the following components:

#### Backend Application (Node.js â€“ TypeScript)
- An API endpoint for listing apartments.  
- An API endpoint for getting apartment details.  
- An API for adding apartments.

#### Responsive Frontend Application (Next.js)
- Apartment listing page.  
- Apartment details page.  
- Responsive design for mobile and web with good UI taken into consideration.

#### Database
A relational or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).

---

### Bonus Task
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Enable searching on the apartment listing page by unit name, unit number, or project.

---

### Instructions
- The application should be containerized and configured to run with a single command through **docker-compose** including the frontend, backend, and database.  
- Push your code to a public or private **GitHub repository**.  
  - If the repository is private, grant read access to **dev.hiring@nawy.com** (username: **NawyDevHiring**) as a collaborator.  
- Evaluation criteria will be based on the following (in order):  
  **Functionality**, **code quality**, **project structure**, and **documentation**.

Version: **v1.1**

### Tips
- Be creative with this. We want to see a fully functional assignment. When in doubt, make an executive decision. Functionality is more important than look and feel. If youâ€™re done early, feel free to polish it up.  
- Use any frameworks/libraries you like. Pick something you are comfortable with.  
- Document your code/API as much as you can.  
- Once finished, please reply to your assignment email with the **GitHub repository link(s)** that contain(s) usage/setup instructions.

Version: **v1.1**
