# API Testing with HTTP Files

This folder contains `.http` files for testing the Nawy Apartment Listing API endpoints using REST Client extensions.

## Setup

### For VS Code

Install the **REST Client** extension by Huachao Mao:

- Extension ID: `humao.rest-client`
- [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

### For IntelliJ/WebStorm

The HTTP Client is built-in. Just open any `.http` file and click the play button next to each request.

## Prerequisites

Before testing the API, ensure:

1. **Backend is running**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Database is set up**:

   ```bash
   npm run db:push    # Apply schema
   npm run db:seed    # Seed with 50 apartments
   ```

3. **Backend is accessible** at `http://localhost:3001`

## Files

### üìÑ `workflow.http`

**Complete end-to-end testing workflow**

- **Start here** for a full system test
- Follow Steps 1-12 in order for typical user journey
- Includes alternative user journeys (budget buyer, luxury buyer, etc.)
- Demonstrates all features: browsing, filtering, searching, creating

**Use case**: Testing the complete user experience from browsing to viewing details

### üìÑ `apartments.http`

**All apartment endpoints with examples**

- 40+ test cases covering all functionality
- Organized by category:
  - Basic pagination
  - Search and filtering
  - Get specific apartment
  - Create apartment
  - Edge cases and validation
  - Performance testing

**Use case**: Testing specific features or debugging individual endpoints

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Start the backend**:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Open `workflow.http`** in VS Code

3. **Click "Send Request"** above each request (or use keyboard shortcut)

4. **Review the response** in the right panel

### Using Variables

Each file has variables defined at the top:

```http
@baseUrl = http://localhost:3001/api/v1
@contentType = application/json
```

You can:

- Modify `@baseUrl` for different environments (staging, production)
- Use `{{variable}}` syntax throughout the file
- Override variables by creating an `http-client.env.json` file

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **VS Code**: `Ctrl+Alt+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+R` (Mac)
- **IntelliJ**: `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac)

### Copying IDs Between Requests

Many requests require apartment IDs. To copy an ID:

1. Run a list request (e.g., GET all apartments)
2. Copy an `id` from the response
3. Paste it into the specific apartment request URL

**Example**:

```http
### First, get the list
GET {{baseUrl}}/apartments

### Response includes:
{
  "data": [
    { "id": "08a4c886-f202-4909-8f07-d3ce8f5520de", ... }
  ]
}

### Then use the ID
GET {{baseUrl}}/apartments/08a4c886-f202-4909-8f07-d3ce8f5520de
```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organizing Tests

- **Use comments** (`###`) to separate test cases
- **Name your tests** clearly: "Get Apartment - Success Case"
- **Group related tests** together

### Debugging

- **Check response status** first (200, 400, 404, 500)
- **Review response body** for error messages
- **Verify request format** matches expected structure
- **Check backend logs** for detailed errors

### Performance Testing

- Test with different page sizes (12, 20, 50, 100)
- Test complex filters with multiple conditions
- Test search queries with varying lengths
- Monitor response times in REST Client output

### Data Management

- Use unique unit numbers when creating test apartments
- Consider cleaning up test data periodically
- Use descriptive names for test apartments (e.g., "TEST-...")

## Environment Configuration

### Creating Environment File

For different environments, create `http-client.env.json`:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3001/api/v1"
  },
  "staging": {
    "baseUrl": "https://staging.nawy.com/api/v1"
  },
  "production": {
    "baseUrl": "https://api.nawy.com/api/v1"
  }
}
```

Then select environment in VS Code REST Client.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused

**Error**: `ECONNREFUSED`

**Solution**:

- Ensure backend is running: `npm run start:dev`
- Check if port 3001 is correct
- Verify no firewall blocking

### 404 Not Found

**Error**: Endpoint not found

**Solution**:

- Check `@baseUrl` includes `/api/v1`
- Verify endpoint path spelling
- Ensure backend routes are registered

### 400 Bad Request

**Error**: Validation failed

**Solution**:

- Check request body format (JSON syntax)
- Verify all required fields are present
- Check data types (number vs string)
- Review validation rules in DTO

### Empty Results

**Error**: Returns empty array `[]`

**Solution**:

- Verify database has data: `npm run db:seed`
- Check if filters are too restrictive
- Try removing filters one by one

### Database Errors

**Error**: 500 with database error

**Solution**:

- Ensure database is running (Docker)
- Check database connection in `.env`
- Run migrations: `npm run db:push`
- Seed data: `npm run db:seed`

## Alternative Tools

You can also use these alternatives to test the API:

- **Postman**: Import via OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Insomnia**: Similar to Postman
- **Thunder Client**: VS Code extension
- **curl**: Command-line tool
- **HTTPie**: Modern curl alternative
- **Bruno**: Open-source API client

### Example curl Command

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/apartments?page=1&limit=12" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
